# Project Consolidation

This repo (`home-still/apple_health_source`) is the canonical home for the
Apple-Health personal-data stack:

- **iOS app** — `ios/HealthSync/` (SwiftUI, HealthKit read/write, speech-to-meal).
- **REST API** — `api/` (Rust, axum, JWT, Ollama meal parsing, USDA nutrition).
- **Database DDLs** — `api/migrations/` (Postgres 17 + TimescaleDB hypertables).
- **MCP server** — `mcp/` (`healthsync-mcp`, read-only SQL tool for Claude Desktop).

## Archived predecessors

The following GitHub repos have been archived. They are read-only and preserved
for history; no code was deleted. Each of their READMEs now carries a banner
pointing back here.

## Live services not affected by this consolidation

`auto_health` remains the backend for `https://health.lolzlab.com`. Archiving
the GitHub repo does not stop the running binary on the Pi. A future migration
may re-point that hostname to this repo's API, but that effort is out of scope
for the consolidation recorded here.
